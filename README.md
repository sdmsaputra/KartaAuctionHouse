# KartaAuctionHouse

KartaAuctionHouse is a modern and feature-rich auction house plugin for PaperMC servers. It provides a robust, intuitive, and scalable platform for players to buy and sell items, fully integrated with Vault-based economies and PlaceholderAPI.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced Auction Mechanics**:
  - **Standard Auctions**: Players can list items for a set starting price.
  - **Instant Buy (Buy It Now)**: Sellers can set a "buy now" price for immediate purchase. This option is disabled once a bid is placed.
  - **Reserve Price**: Sellers can set a minimum price they're willing to accept. If the auction ends below this price, the item is returned to the seller.
  - **Anti-Sniping**: If a bid is placed in the final seconds of an auction, the auction time is automatically extended, giving others a fair chance to bid again.
  - **Minimum Bid Increment**: Configure a minimum bid increase, either as a flat amount or a percentage, to prevent minuscule bid spam.

- **Enhanced GUI**:
  - **Intuitive Interface**: A clean and modern GUI for browsing, bidding, and managing auctions.
  - **Filtering & Sorting**: Easily sort auctions by price, time remaining, or newest listings.
  - **Category Tabs**: Filter items by category (Weapons, Armor, Blocks, Misc) for easier browsing.
  - **Search Functionality**: Search for items by name using `/ah search <keyword>` or the in-game search button.
  - **Pagination**: Smoothly navigate through multiple pages of auctions.
  - **Color-Coded Affordability**: Item prices are colored green if you can afford them and red if you can't, providing instant feedback.

- **Real-time Notifications**:
  - Stay informed with instant notifications for key events:
    - When you are outbid.
    - When an auction you bid on ends.
    - When an item you listed is sold or expires.
  - **Configurable Channels**: Choose how you receive notifications: chat message, action bar, title/subtitle, or sound effects.
  - **Personalized Settings**: Players can toggle their notifications on or off using `/ah notify <on/off>`.

- **Robust Economy & Logging**:
  - **Vault & KartaEmeraldCurrency Support**: Seamlessly integrates with any Vault-supported economy plugin.
  - **Transaction Tax**: A configurable tax/commission can be taken from each sale.
  - **Full Transaction Logging**: Every sale, expiration, and cancellation is logged to a MySQL database for administrative oversight.

- **PlaceholderAPI Support**:
  - Display auction data on scoreboards, holograms, and more.
  - Available placeholders: `%kartauctionhouse_highest_bid%`, `%kartauctionhouse_time_left%`, `%kartauctionhouse_seller%`.
